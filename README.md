What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project featured elements of several different types of design. There were multiple elements of visual design needed to select textures, lighting, and other visual aspects of creating the 3D scene. Design also came into play when selecting the shapes which would make up the elements of the scene, and placing them in the 3D space.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
This project was well spaced into modules which focused on different aspects of the overall design of the scene, beginning with selecting which elements to represent and planning out what shapes would be used and where they would need to go. From there, I slowly worked on adding elements to the project such as navigation, textures, and lighting, and finally completed the project by adding in the remaining elements I had selected in the beginning and applying texutures to them.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The design process of this project is applicable across other projects that I will work on because I needed to practice researching and planning the project before beginning work, as well as time management and troubleshooting. These are valuable skills which can be applied to other topics outside of computer visualizations.


What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I have some experience with coding but none with computer visualizations, so most of the concepts included in this project were new to me. I learned how to select photos to turn into texutures for my scene and apply them to objects, as well as think about objects in a 3D perspective in order to plan how to map them in the code.

How did iteration factor into your development?
The process of developing the final 3D scene for this project was very iterative. Spaced out across multiple modules and weeks of the course, I slowly added concepts from the reading and coursework to elements of my scene, and expanded upon my scene each week.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Because I was completely new to computer visualizations at the beginning of the course, I needed to plan time to work through the milestones with enough time to troubleshoot and read additional resources to ensure I understood how each function worked. This is something which was a struggle in the beginning but a practice which I learned to adopt in the first several weeks.


How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I plan to continue my path in cybersecurity, however becoming familiar with as many technical concepts as I can will continue to benefit me as I understand how systems work and are connected. We used the OpenGL API in this course, and API usage is a topic which I will continue to develop knowledge on in the future.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Even though I don't plan on directly using the techniques I learned in this course in my career, there are broader concepts which are absolutely applicable and useful for my professional development. For example, the more exposure to programming languages I have, the easier it will be for me to become proficient in one or more at some point. Additionally, working in the technical field it is helpful to have an understanding of the jargon, concepts, and functionality of a wide array of topics to better understand the technical ecosystem.
